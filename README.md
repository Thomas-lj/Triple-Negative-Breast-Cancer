# Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This project seeks to identify tumor subtypes of triple negative breast cancer using deep unsupervised clustering. This project is part of a masters thesis, 2020.

# Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering
The project implements Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering (https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf) to optimize a joint objective function:

# Tissues
As part of a proof of concept, a tissue classificator was implemented to cluster different tissue types.
Convergence with K=4 clusters, Î³=0.1>

# Tumor
Tumor tiles like these were clustered assuming K=4, 8, 12 and 20 clusters.
