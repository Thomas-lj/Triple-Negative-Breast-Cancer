# Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This project seeks to identify tumor subtypes of triple negative breast cancer using deep unsupervised clustering. This project is part of Thomas' masters thesis, 2020.

# Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering
The project implements Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering (https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf) to optimize a joint objective function (L) with both a reconstruction (L_r) and clustering loss (L_c):

Reconstruction loss:

Model presentation (as illustrated by Guo. et al.) of DCEC, where q is the latent representation vector of an image:

# Tissues
A tissue classificator was implemented to cluster different tissue types: Tumor, stroma, fat and lymphocytes.
Examples of tissue types, from left column: fat, stroma, lymphocytes and tumor:

This illustrates Principal Component (PC1 and PC2 on the axes) from the latent representation q (the condensed image presentation between the encoder and decoder).
Example of cluster convergence with hyperparameters K=4 clusters, Î³=0.1:

# Tumor
Tumor tiles like these were clustered assuming K=4, 8, 12 and 20 clusters.
Example of cluster assignment latent representations:

Examples of Tumor tiles for K=4 clusters suggests a color dependency to the cluster assignments:
